# Searotes
Searotes is an application originally to help with the study. An application in which once a path has been specified, it can help us to search for content among the PDF and DOCX files we have in that path.

## Steps to install
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Change in the file `configuration.py` the path value, by the path you want to consult.

## Steps to launch the desktop app
* `env/Scripts/python main.py`
